# Questions

- Pydantic BaseModels, frozen=true by default?
- Simarlalry, default to tuples instead of lists when read only?
- General pattern: immutable where possible
- Prefer generic interfaces - i.e. return Iterable not list
- common convention for iterations?
  - enumerate
  - for x in list
  - for k, v in thing.items()
  - standardise variable names to? ie. what index shoild be called: i, idx, index

  MAKE SURE NONE OF THESE RULES CONFLICT WITH
